# Inventory management

For this project, I implemented a web-based application that manages inventory. It has some basic functionalities like user-login, user-log out and user-sign up. It also supports users to build inventory(add new item), query in inventory(search), delete item, update item, and so on. Beside these functionalities, it contains a table to display the information of each item in the home page. Users can sort this table by different attributes, like category, inventory and date updated.Last but not least, it will display the information of some items that have low stock or haven't been updated for more than 30 days so that users are able to take measures to those items.





## Technologies
